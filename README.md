# Native Dio Client

A client for [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) which makes use of [`cupertino_http`](https://pub.dev/packages/cupertino_http) and [`cronet_http`](https://pub.dev/packages/cronet_http) to delegate HTTP requests to the native platform instead of the `dart:io` platforms.

Inspired by the [Dart 2.18 release blog](https://medium.com/dartlang/dart-2-18-f4b3101f146c).
